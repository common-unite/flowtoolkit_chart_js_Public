"""Preflight check: is a specific managed package already installed?

The usual idiom, ``'<namespace>' in tasks.get_installed_packages()``, cannot be
used for a same-namespace extension. This extension is namespaced
``FlowToolKit``, exactly like the base package, and ``GetInstalledPackages``
returns a dict keyed by namespace, so that check is already true the moment the
base is installed and a genuine first install would be skipped.

Querying ``InstalledSubscriberPackage`` by package NAME distinguishes the two.

Written with a ``package_name`` option so every FlowToolKit extension can reuse it.

Sets ``return_values["is_installed"]`` to True/False.

Register in ``cumulusci.yml``::

    tasks:
        check_chart_js_installed:
            class_path: tasks.check_package_installed.CheckPackageInstalled
            options:
                package_name: "Flow Tool Kit: Chart.js"
